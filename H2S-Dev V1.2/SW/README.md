This example code in (H2S-DEV-THS-V0.1.ino) sends a valid LoRaWAN packet over The Helium network with a payload containing temperature and humidity data as they are read from a DHT11 sensor, connected to GPIO13 using frequency and encryption settings according your region.

The data format and the JSON script for decoding it will be soon described in separate article in the project's GitHub (https://github.com/hobbyiot/HELIUM-SENSORS)
