# HELIUM-SENSORS
# Helium IoT Network Sensor Development board

The project targets a LoRaWAN device - Helium IoT Network Sensor Development board (H2S-Dev) product with GNSS tracking option for primary usage with the LoRaWAN based Helium network. The board is mainly targeted to makers and hobbyists.

Main blocks include ESP32 MCU, SX1276 radio, I2C standard interfaces and GPS module with integrated antenna; Dual power USB-C and LiPo battery with charging circuit; mechanically and electrically compatible as a Raspberry Pi HAT.

The current version of the Helium IoT Network Sensor Development board (H2S-Dev) is V1.1
